-- | This module is a work in progress.
-- This work will eventually be merged into the
-- sfml-audio module under Sound.SFML.Mixer
--
-- Functions that return StateT Mixer IO () are inherently
-- stateful towards the mixer.  Meaning that they
-- modify and update the status of the channels in
-- the mixer.
